Final winner of >sudo:city smart city hackathon organised by >sudo challenge from Cambridge Applied Research (https://www.cambridgeapplied.co.uk/) sponsored by an ambitious startup (https://www.alcheratechnologies.com/). Smart Cambridge (https://smartcambridge.org/), a Cambridge city council intiative is one of the main partners.

## Context

Smarter cities look like connected environments with future technologies, but are rarely run as "smart" places, neglecting to leverage the vast and complex data sources distributed throughout the space. From airports, to train stations, toll raods to busy urban intersections, the world of mobility is ripe for disruption. With lots of stakeholders across the built environment, and outdated approaches to operations, innovations in cities are few and far between.

There are huge opportunities to better engage citizens, use data, and prepare for the arrival of future mobility solutions like autonomous vehicles. We see the future of smart cities as being dynamic, user-centric and green.

### Solution proposed

More and more people are aware of our impact on the environment around us and they are actively making ethical and environmental decision. Living in the city, tranportation is a huge part of our lives. What if you are not in a hurry or you are willing to take some extra time on the commute journey, instead of the fastest way, you can travel in the 'greenest' way. This simple webapp allows you to find out about top 3,4 fastest routes return by Google Maps API and their carbon emissions are displayed by the time taken for a tree to absorb. This we believe can nudge users towards travelling more environmentally friendly.

The webapp is built on Python and incorporate Department of Transport API, Google Maps API and carbon emission model through collecting online information on various travel types.
